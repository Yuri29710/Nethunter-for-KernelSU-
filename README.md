Kali Nethunter (arm64) for KernelSU

Hello! I'll be straight to the point here. How do I install this? Download the Kali Nethunter generic rootfs from "https://old.kali.org/nethunter-images/kali-2024.4/" and open it, copy the file named kalifs, extension tar.xz to /sdcard, and then install this zip from this repository on your KernelSU. Bugs/problems? you say. My telegram is https://t.me/hlprx49 or @hlprx49 (helperx).
