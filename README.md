# Nethunter-for-KernelSU-
Kali Nethunter (arm64/arm32) for KernelSU

Hello! I'll be straight to the point here. How do I install this? Download the Kali Nethunter generic rootfs from "https://old.kali.org/nethunter-images/kali-2024.4/" and open it, copy the file named kalifs, extension tar.xz to /sdcard, and then install this zip from this repository on your KernelSU. Bugs/problems? you say. My telegram is https://t.me/hlprx49 or @hlprx49 (helperx).
/ I won't send the source code, you already have it. Just extract it and you'll see my changes. Trust me, this module is not malicious, don't worry about "source code" or anything. (I'm having trouble uploading, so I won't upload the "source code".)
