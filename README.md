# Nethunter-for-KernelSU-
Kali Nethunter (Generic) (ARMv8l) for KernelSU

Hello! I'll be straight to the point here. How do I install this? ~~Download the Kali Nethunter generic rootfs from **https://old.kali.org/nethunter-images/kali-2024.4/** and open it, copy the file named kalifs, extension tar.xz to /sdcard, and then install this zip from this repository on your KernelSU.~~ (latest releases are flash ready.) problems? you say. My telegram is t.me/hlprx49 or @hlprx49 (helperx).
/ **I won't send the source code, you already have it. just extract my module and you will get access to my changes.** \ ~ / **Full Credits to Kali Nethunter Team**, this module is theirs, I just made my changes, the module structure and miscellaneous are still the same. /// Why did I mention ARMv8/ up there? Well, this module only works on arm64_binder64/arm32_binder64 devices, pure 32-bit is not supported (look for armhf variants). I can't upload files larger than 2gb, so only minimal variants here. you can still install the full Kali package by running this in the Kali terminal: apt update -y && apt upgrade -y && apt-get install kali-linux-everything kali-menu kali-nethunter-full kali-root-login -y
